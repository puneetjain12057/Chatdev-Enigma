According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Recreated a fully functional Enigma machine, faithfully replicating its World War II era functionality".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

<COMMENT>
The highest priority comment is that the `Enigma` class in `enigma.py` is missing the implementation of the `add_rotor` and `set_reflector` methods. These methods are necessary for adding rotors and setting the reflector in the Enigma machine.

To fix this, you need to implement the `add_rotor` and `set_reflector` methods in the `Enigma` class. Here's an example implementation:

```python
def add_rotor(self, rotor):
    self.rotors.append(rotor)

def set_reflector(self, reflector):
    self.reflector = reflector
```

Make sure to add these methods to the `Enigma` class in `enigma.py` and ensure they are properly called in the `EnigmaApp` class in `main.py` when setting up the Enigma machine.

Once you have made these changes, the Enigma machine should be fully functional and ready to use.

Make sure to add these methods to the `Enigma` class in `enigma.py` and ensure they are properly called in the `EnigmaApp` class in `main.py` when setting up the Enigma machine.

Once you have made these changes, the Enigma machine should be fully functional and ready to use.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The highest priority comment is that the `Enigma` class in `enigma.py` is missing the implementation of the `add_rotor` and `set_reflector` methods. These methods are necessary for adding rotors and setting the reflector in the Enigma machine.

To fix this, you need to implement the `add_rotor` and `set_reflector` methods in the `Enigma` class. Here's an example implementation:

```python
def add_rotor(self, rotor):
    self.rotors.append(rotor)

def set_reflector(self, reflector):
    self.reflector = reflector
```

Make sure to add these methods to the `Enigma` class in `enigma.py` and ensure they are properly called in the `EnigmaApp` class in `main.py` when setting up the Enigma machine.

Once you have made these changes, the Enigma machine should be fully functional and ready to use."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

```LANGUAGE

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<COMMENT>
The code is missing the necessary imports for the Enigma, Rotor, and Reflector classes in the main.py file. To fix this, you need to add the following import statements at the top of the main.py file:

```python
from enigma import Enigma
from rotor import Rotor
from reflector import Reflector
```

This will ensure that the required classes are imported and accessible in the EnigmaApp class.

Additionally, it would be helpful to add comments to the methods in the Enigma class, Rotor class, and Reflector class to explain their functionality and parameters.

Once you make these changes, the code should meet all the regulations and be ready for use.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The code is missing the necessary imports for the Enigma, Rotor, and Reflector classes in the main.py file. To fix this, you need to add the following import statements at the top of the main.py file:

```python
from enigma import Enigma
from rotor import Rotor
from reflector import Reflector
```

This will ensure that the required classes are imported and accessible in the EnigmaApp class.

Additionally, it would be helpful to add comments to the methods in the Enigma class, Rotor class, and Reflector class to explain their functionality and parameters.

Once you make these changes, the code should meet all the regulations and be ready for use."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary imports for the Enigma, Rotor, and Reflector classes in the main.py file. To fix this, add the following import statements at the top of the main.py file:

```python
from enigma import Enigma
from rotor import Rotor
from reflector import Reflector
```

This will ensure that the required classes are imported and accessible in the EnigmaApp class.

Once you make this change, the code should be able to run without any errors.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary imports for the Enigma, Rotor, and Reflector classes in the main.py file. To fix this, add the following import statements at the top of the main.py file:

```python
from enigma import Enigma
from rotor import Rotor
from reflector import Reflector
```

This will ensure that the required classes are imported and accessible in the EnigmaApp class.

Once you make this change, the code should be able to run without any errors."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)
